# Notes for DiffAug

`by liyle3`



## 1. Motivation

* Data augmention in contrastive learning can be categorized into hand-designed and model-based methods
  * hand-designed methods require human expertise in domain-specific data while sometimes distorting the meaning of the data
  * generative model-based approaches usually require supervised or large-scale external data, which has become a bottleneck constraining model training in many domains



## 2. Method

* **training strategy**

  * sync training
  
  * iterative training
